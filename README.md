# Convex-Hull

This project was done as part of coursework. I have implemented the following three algorithms to find the convex hull for a set of given points.
1. Graham's Scan
2. Jarvis March
3. Andrew's Algorithm

The folder `Test Cases` contains the analysis of ten randomly generated datasets of varying size(1000-15000). Furthermore the `ConvexHull.cpp` file has been properly commented to explain all steps of the algorithm and data structures used. This documentation is also compatbile with softwares like Doxygen to generate automated reports.
